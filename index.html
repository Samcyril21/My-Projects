          I have developed a Twitter feed module that allows users to retrieve
          comments through a click function using the Public API. It efficiently
          fetches JSON files to display the comments, providing a seamless and
          interactive experience for accessing Twitter feeds and engaging with

        <h2>Age-Caculator</h2>
        <p>
          I have developed a basic age calculator using HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript. This calculator takes the user's date of birth as input
          and accurately calculates their age. The simple and intuitive
          interface allows users to enter their birthdate, and the calculator
          instantly displays their current age, making it a handy tool for
          anyone looking to find their age quickly and effortlessly.

          employees by implementing a two-step confirmation process. The
          interface is simple and user-friendly, providing an efficient way to
          manage employee data securely.
